# Hill Cipher Encryption Web App

This project demonstrates encryption and decryption using the **Hill Cipher (2×2)** — based on **Linear Algebra** concepts of invertible matrices and modular arithmetic.

## Features
- Encrypt and decrypt text using a 2×2 matrix key.
- Generate random invertible keys or enter manually.
- Clean, minimal dark interface for professional presentation.

## Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
